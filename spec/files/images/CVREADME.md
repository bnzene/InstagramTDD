# Eleanor Kavanagh-Brown

Human being who lives mostly on the planet Earth. I travel as much as I can, and have been to some pretty out-of-the-way places and done some surprising things. The main thing I've learned from this is always - ALWAYS - know where your towel is. Second, keep an eye on your drink. Third, everything is linked somehow, and knowledge acquired in one area can almost always shine light on something else - nothing is wasted.

I'm constantly learning and trying to listen better; if there's a principle I live by, that's it. This and my curiosity mean I've had a go at a lot of things; primarily, I'm a developer and music producer/sound artist. My current major project is a sound installation using arduino, piezos and Pure Data to turn air currents into music.

This inveterate curiosity has pushed me to learn new skills in order to realise creative ideas: not least MIDI programming, modular synthesis and Pure Data. I'm related to the guy who invented the steam train so like to think it's that spirit at work. 

This experimental and optimistic approach is why I'd like to be a junior dev in a music software company. With my programming skills, enthusiasm for TDD, experience as a user of audio software and grounding in audio, I'm ideally placed to work in developing and honing tools for musicians.

I'd like to work in a creative company which pushes the boundaries; where everyone has the space, respect and responsibility to be themselves, get invested and take ownership of their work. My hope as a junior is to have the chance constantly to learn new technologies, hone my software craftsmanship and further internalise best TDD practice and SOLID principles. It's also very important to me to work with a wide range of people and perspectives, and to be able to learn from the best.

## Skills

#### Hardware Hacking, video art; film editing; music production

I'm an inveterate experimenter, will try anything once just to find out what it's like or how it works, and insatiably curious about the world. I'm a tinkerer, and have made several personal creative projects using technologies including Arduino, Pure Data, OpenOSC, Adobe Creative Suite and MIDI, connecting technologies to build interactive sound installations which use things like gesture and touch to create music.

#### Journalism, research, creative and academic writing
I'm a contributor at Impakter Magazine, an online publication which aims to improve the quality of online content. My main area of focus is the intersection of music with technology. Coming from an arts degree background I've had the opportunity further to hone some already well-developed research techniques, which have served me well in getting to grips with new technologies quickly.

#### Marketing

- Ran the marketing for a small catering business for 6 months. I had free rein to create marketing materials, and manage and streamline their social media accounts.
- As a small company everyone mucked in; the company had just moved into new premises, so I also helped with everything from supplier research to food prep.
- Built and customised a WordPress blog (now inactive) [Capital Cooking LDN](https://capitalcookinglondon.wordpress.com/), including using HTML and CSS.
- Strong understanding of how to shape the tone of a brand's communications and target marketing to the intended audience, and with experience in communication and copywriting for the various facets of a company's online presence.
